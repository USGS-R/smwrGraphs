\usage{
setGroupPlot(current, Grps = 1, name = "", what = "points",
  type = "solid", width = "standard", symbol = "circle",
  filled = TRUE, size = 0.09, color = "black")
}
\arguments{
\item{current}{the plot parameters specified in the call to the high-level
graphing function.}

\item{Grps}{the number of groups.}

\item{name}{the name associated with the group. See \bold{Details}.}

\item{what}{what kind of plot. Must be one of "points," symbols only;
"lines," line segments connecting points only; "both," line segments
connecting isolated symbols; "overlaid," line segments connecting points
with symbols; "stairstep," stairstep line segments; or "vertical," vertical
lines from the y-axis origin to the y value at each x value.}

\item{type}{the type of line, if drawn. Must be one of "solid," "dashed,"
"dotted."}

\item{width}{the width of line, if drawn. Must be one of "standard,"
resulting in a line width of about 0.7 points; "color," resulting in a line
width of about 0.8 points; "bold," resulting in a line width of about 1.
point; or "hairline" resulting in a line width of about 0.5 points. Note
these values are doubled if the \code{font} argument to \code{setPage} is
"PPT."}

\item{symbol}{type symbol, if drawn. Must be one of "circle," "uptri"
(upward pointing triangle), "plus," "x," "diamond," "downtri" (downward
pointing triangle), "square," or "dot."}

\item{filled}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, then fill the symbol. Valid only 
for \code{symbol} equal to "circle," "uptri," "diamond," "downtri," or "square."}

\item{size}{the size of the symol in inches, if drawn.}

\item{color}{the color of the plotted values for each group. Can be a named
color, such as "black" or "gray50" or an RGB color like "#A09623."}
}
\value{
A list having two components:\cr \item{current}{a list like
\code{current} with the defaults set} \item{Explan}{a list for creating an
explanation}
}
\description{
Sets plot control list for groups of data (support function).
}
\details{
If the \code{name} component in the original call to the high-level plot is
"Auto," then the description for the explanation is taken from the value in
the \code{Group} argument in that call. Otherwise the user must specify a
name for each group.

If the \code{color} component in the original call
to the high-level plot is "Auto," then the colors for each group are based
on a sequence of 15 colors that are easily distinguished from each other. If
there are more than 15 groups, then a gray scale is used with no guarantee
of easily distinguished colors.
