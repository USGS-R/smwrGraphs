\usage{
setMultiPlot(current, Nobs = 1, name = "", what = "points",
  type = "solid", width = "standard", symbol = "circle",
  filled = TRUE, size = 0.09, color = "black", order = "as is")
}
\arguments{
\item{current}{the plot parameters specified in the call to the high-level
graphing function.}

\item{Nobs}{the number of observations.}

\item{name}{the name associated with the observation. See \bold{Details}.}

\item{what}{what kind of plot. Must be one of "points," symbols only;
"lines," line segments connecting points only; "both," line segments
connecting isolated symbols; "overlaid," line segments connecting points
with symbols; "stairstep," stairstep line segments; or "vertical," vertical
lines from the y-axis origin to the y value at each x value.}

\item{type}{the type of line, if drawn. Must be one of "solid," "dashed,"
"dotted."}

\item{width}{the width of the line, if drawn. Must be one of "standard,"
resulting in a line width of about 0.7 points; "color," resulting in a line
width of about 0.8 points; "bold," resulting in a line width of about 1
point; or "hairline" resulting in a line width of about 0.5 points. Note
these values are doubled if the \code{font} argument to \code{setPage} is
"PPT."}

\item{symbol}{type symbol, if drawn. Must be one of "circle;" "uptri,"
upward pointing triangle; "plus;" "x;" "diamond;" "downtri," downward
pointing triangle; "square;" or "dot."}

\item{filled}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, then fill the symbol. Valid only for
\code{symbol} equal to "circle," "uptri," "diamond," "downtri," or "square."}

\item{size}{the size of the symol in inches, if drawn.}

\item{color}{the color of the plotted values. Can be a named color, such as
"black" or "gray50" or an RGB color like "#4056FF."}

\item{order}{specify the order of the symbols in the explanation. Can be "as
is'--do nothing to order in explanation, "sort" or "increasing"---put into
sorted order, "decreasing"--- put in reverse order; or a vector theat
specifies the exact order.}
}
\value{
A list having two components:\cr \item{current}{a list like
\code{current} with the defaults set} \item{Explan}{a list for creating an
explanation}
}
\description{
Sets plot control list for individuals in data (support function).
}
\details{
Each of the arguments from \code{name} through \code{color} must have one
entry for each observation. If a single value is given, then it is
replicated for each observation. In general, it is convenient to set up a
data frame with columns for group names with common values for the line or
symbol. It is required that each group have common values for the line or
symbol.
