\arguments{
\item{x}{data that can be treated as a regularly-spaced time series. Missing
values are permitted, but result in missing seasons.}

\item{SeasonLine}{control parameters of the lines in the plot. See
\bold{Details}.}

\item{SeasonPoint}{control parameters of the points in the plot. See
\bold{Details}.}

\item{yaxis.log}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, then log-transform the y axis.}

\item{yaxis.range}{set the range of the y axis. See \bold{Details}.}

\item{ylabels}{set the y-axis labels. See \code{\link{linearPretty}} for
details.}

\item{xlabels}{set the x-axis labels and number of seasons when \code{x} is
a simple numeric vector, may be a single numeric value indicating the number
of seasons in \code{x} or a vector of the names of the seasons. See
\code{\link{namePretty}} for details. If \code{X} is a time-series object,
then the labels are set to the frequency characteristic of \code{x}.}

\item{xtitle}{the x-axis title (also called x-axis caption).}

\item{ytitle}{the y-axis title (also called y-axis caption).}

\item{caption}{the figure caption.}

\item{margin}{set the plot area margins, in units of lines of text. Generally
all NA or the output from \code{setGraph} if appropriate.}

\item{\dots}{any additional arguments required for specific methods.}
}
\value{
Information about the graph.
}
\description{
Creates a plot of a regular series on a seasonal cycle; the annual values for each season
are plotted.
}
\details{
The argument \code{what} for \code{SeasonLine} must be either "lines" or
"vertical."  See \code{\link{monthplot}} for more information.

The argument \code{what} for \code{SeasonPoint} can be set to "none" to suppress
drawing of symbols or "points" to draw symbols at the ends of the line segments
described by \code{SeasonLine}.

For linear axes, the range can be set to virtually any pair of values. For 
log axes, the choice of range is more resticted---for less than one log-cycle,
powers of whole numbers can be used; from 1 to about 3 log cycles, the choces 
should be powers of 3 or 10; and for more than 3 log cycles, the range sould be 
expressed only in powers of 10.
}
\note{
A call should be made to \code{setPage} to set up the graphics
environment before calling \code{seriesPlot}.
