\arguments{
\item{x}{the x-axis data. For method \code{list}, x is a list that contains
components \code{x} and \code{y} and the \code{y} argument is not used.
Missing values are permitted but omitted in the regression.}

\item{y}{the y-axis data. Missing values are permitted but omitted.}

\item{Plot}{parameters defining the characteristics of the plot. See
\code{\link{setPlot}} for a description of the parameters.}

\item{Model}{parameters for displaying the simple linear regression model.
See \bold{Details}.}

\item{current}{the current plot information. Typically, this would be the
output from one of the graph creation functions like \code{xyPlot}.}

\item{\dots}{not used, required for other methods.}
}
\value{
The current plot information, the x and y components are the data, not the line.
The regression model is included as the lm component.
}
\description{
Adds a simple linear regression line to a scatter plot.
}
\details{
The \code{Model} argument sets up the information to include the regression
model equation on the graphs. Within \code{Model}, \code{x} is the name to use for the
explanatory variable, \code{y} is the name to use for the response variable, \code{form}
indicates the form that the regression model should take if the variable are log
transformed; "exp" indicates that the model equation should be expressed as an exponent,
any other string indicates thet the model should be expressed using the transformation 
functions; and \code{where} indicates where to place the equation. The value for
\code{where} is a two letter code based on "upper," "center," or "lower" and "right,"
"center," or "left"---for example "ul" would place the model equaiton in the upper left
corner.
