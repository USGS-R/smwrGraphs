\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class "princomp" that has the information to create
a biplot.}

\item{Which}{sequence of two numbers indicating which components to plot.}

\item{Scale}{either a character string indicating the scaling option between
observations and variables, or numeric value controling the scaling. If
character, then must be one of "auto," "distance," "symmetric," "variance,"
or "interpolative." See \bold{Details}.}

\item{obsPlot}{control information to plot the observations.  See
\code{\link{setPlot}} for a description of the parameters.}

\item{varPlot}{control information to plot the variables.  See
\code{\link{setPlot}} for a description of the parameters. For \code{yPlot},
symbol can be "arrow" to indicate that an arrow is to be drawn from the
origin.}

\item{obsPlotLabels}{control information for the observation labels. See
\bold{Details}.}

\item{varPlotLabels}{control information for the variable labels. See
\bold{Details}.}

\item{ylabels}{set y-axis labels for the observation data.}

\item{xlabels}{set x-axis labels for the observation data.}

\item{ylabels2}{set y-axis labels for the variable data.}

\item{xlabels2}{set x-axis labels for the variable data.}

\item{xtitle}{x-axis title (also called x-axis caption) for the observation data.}

\item{ytitle}{y-axis title (also called y-axis caption) for the observation data.}

\item{xtitle2}{x-axis title (also called x-axis caption) for the variable data.}

\item{ytitle2}{y-axis title (also called y-axis caption) for the variable data.}

\item{range.factor}{a numeric factor by which to expand the axis ranges so
that labels can be drawn.}

\item{caption}{the figure caption.}

\item{margin}{set the plot area margins, in units of lines of text. Generally
all NA or the output from \code{setGraph} if appropriate.}

\item{\dots}{not used, required for other methods.}
}
\value{
Information about the graph.

\description{
Produces a biplot, which is a plot of two different types of data on the same
graph, from a principal component analysis.
}
\details{
The scaling between observations and variables is controlled by
\code{Scale}, which can take any value between 0 and 1 or a character string
indicating a specific scaling. The options for the character string are:
"distance," which produces a plot where the observations retain their
approximate relation with respect to Eucldiean distances and correponds to a
numeric value of 1; "variance," which produces a plot where the cosine of
the angle between the variable vectors is related to the correlation between
the variables and corresponds to a numeric value of 0; "symmetric," which
tries to balance the range of values for observations and variables to give
a pleasing graph and corresponds to a numeric value of 0.5; or "Auto," which
is the same as "variance." Another option for \code{Scale} is
"interpolative," which produces a specialized axis scaling so that the
approximate values of the variables can be obtained for each observation. It
is not implemented in this version.\cr

The \code{obsPlotLabels} and \code{varPlotLabels} arguments must be tagged
lists with these components: \describe{ \item{labels}{the labels. For
\code{xPlotLabels}, "rownames" means use the row names from \code{x} to
generate the labels. For \code{yPlotLabels}, "colnames" means use the column
names from \code{y} to generate the labels. Otherwise a character vector of
the labels.} \item{dir}{the direction the label text is placed from the
object.} \item{size}{the size of the label text.} \item{offset}{the distance
the labels is placed relative to the object.} \item{color}{the color of the
label text.} }

A call should be made to \code{setPage} to set up the graphics
