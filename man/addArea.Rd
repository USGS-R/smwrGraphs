\title{Add a Filled Polygon to Graph}
\usage{
addArea(x, y, ybase = NULL, Area = list(name = "", color = "gray",
  outline = "black"), current = list(yaxis.log = FALSE, yaxis.rev =
  FALSE, xaxis.log = FALSE))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the x-axis coordinates of the polygon. Missing values are not
permitted.}

\item{y}{the y-axis coordinates of the polygon. Missing values are not
permitted.}

\item{ybase}{the y-axis coordinates of the polygon. See \bold{Details}.
Missing values are not permitted.}

\item{Area}{parameters defining the characteristics of the area. See
\code{\link{areaPlot}} for details.}

\item{current}{the current plot information. Typically, this would be the
output from one of the graph creation functions like \code{xyPlot}.}
}
\value{
The current plot information is returned invisibly.
}
\description{
Adds a filled polygon (area) to a graph.
}
\details{
If \code{ybase} is NULL, then \code{x} and \code{y} should form a complete
polygon, which can be closed or open. Otherwise, \code{ybase} can be a single
value in which case the area between \code{ybase} and \code{y} is treated as
the area, or \code{ybase} can be a vector as long as \code{y} and the area
between is treated as the area to be shaded.
